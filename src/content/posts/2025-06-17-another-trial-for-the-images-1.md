Africa Policy Lens is deeply concerned about the Ghanaian Parliament’s rushed approval of a new GH₵1-per-litre tax on fuel under a “certificate of urgency.” Late on June 3, 2025, Parliament amended the Energy Sector Levies Act to increase the Energy Sector Shortfall and Debt Repayment Levy on petrol and diesel by GH₵1 – raising it to GH₵1.95 per litre for petrol and GH₵1.93 for diesel. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) was exempted. This statement provides historical context on Ghana’s fuel levies, examines inconsistencies with the 2025 national budget, explains how fuel prices are determined, and analyzes the likely impact on vulnerable citizens and recent disinflation gains. We conclude with an urgent call for fiscal responsibility, transparency, and protection of the economically vulnerable.

## Background: Ghana’s Fuel Levies and ESLA History

For decades, successive governments in Ghana have turned to fuel taxes and levies as an “easy to collect” revenue source. Demand for petrol and diesel is relatively inelastic, making such taxes a quick way to mobilize funds for public coffers. By the mid-2010s, a patchwork of fuel levies existed – including a Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) Debt Recovery Levy, a Road Fund levy for road maintenance, and other charges – many introduced to tackle specific crises.
