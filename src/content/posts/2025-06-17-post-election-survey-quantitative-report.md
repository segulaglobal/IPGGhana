## **Introduction**

The ruling New Patriotic Party lost against the opposition National Democratic Congress in the recently held general elections.
The purpose of this survey was to find out from the Ghanaian voters who they voted for and for what reasons. In addition, the voter turnout rate was very low! The Coalition of
Domestic Election Observers reported a turnout of 63.9% for the December 2024 elections, compared to 78.89% turnout for the 2020 elections. The survey therefore sought to find out from the absenting voters the reasons why they did not participate in the elections. Finally, the survey used systematic analysis to examine the most popular politician who is likely to win the 2028 presidential contest.
